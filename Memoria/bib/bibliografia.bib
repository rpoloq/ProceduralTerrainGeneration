abstract="Procedural techniques will soon automate many aspects of content creation for computer games. We describe an efficient, deterministic, methodology for procedurally generating 3D game content of arbitrary size and complexity. The technique progressively amplifies simple dynamically generated data structures into complex geometry. We use a procedural pipeline with a minimum set of controls at each stage to facilitate authoring. We show two examples from our research. Our terrain generator can synthesize massive 3D terrains in real-time while our level generator can be used to create indoor environments offline or in real-time.",

Our proposed method focuses on generation of terrains having mountains of prespecified height and spread of base region and peak nearly at a prespecified location. Means of performing advanced tuning on the terrain to produce unusual artifacts on the terrain is also demonstrated and how our algorithm performs better in comparison with the well known terrain generation algorithms when used to solve the same problem is observed.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we propose an automatic method for generating roads based on a weighted anisotropic shortest path algorithm. Given an input scene, we automatically create a path connecting an initial and a final point. The trajectory of the road minimizes a cost function that takes into account the different parameters of the scene including the slope of the terrain, natural obstacles such as rivers, lakes, mountains and forests. The road is generated by excavating the terrain along the path and instantiating generic parameterized models.},

Our framework combines diffusion-based generative network and novel frequency separated terrain features for terrain patch generation. Additionally, we propose to leverage learnable terrain super-resolution for enhancing generated terrain patch followed by novel kernel-based blending of these patches using Perlin noise to generate infinite terrain with realistic terrain features. We provide a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the proposed framework.},
